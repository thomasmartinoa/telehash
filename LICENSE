# 🌐 Telehash Storage (Greenfield)

This repository handles decentralized storage for satellite telemetry and command metadata using **BNB Greenfield**.

It complements the on-chain logging system in [`telehash`](https://github.com/yourusername/telehash).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To store raw telemetry data (e.g., sensor dumps, orbit logs, file hashes) off-chain while logging their metadata and hash on-chain.

---

## 🛰 Smart Contract Link

Smart contract that links storage CIDs + logs to satellites:
